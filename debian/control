Description: Extract source package info from Debian status files
 damngpl will parse a Debian-style /var/lib/dpkg/status file and extract source
 package information about installed packages. This information can be used in
 several ways, usually to download source packages.
 .
 Multiple input files can be specified on the command line, or piped into
 standard input if no files are specified. Results are returned to standard
 output.
 .
 The name damngpl was chosen as a tongue-in-cheek description of its purpose
 (downloading Debian sources for the Finnix project to remain GPL compliant).
 Please do not send hate mail to the author, thinking he is anti-GPL. He's not.
