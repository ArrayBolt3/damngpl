Description: Extract source package info from Debian status files
 damngpl will parse a Debian-style /var/lib/dpkg/status file and extract source
 package information about installed packages. This information can be used in
 several ways, usually to download source packages.
 .
 Multiple input files can be specified on the command line, or piped into
 standard input if no files are specified. Results are returned to standard
 output.

 The name damngpl was chosen as a tongue-in-cheek description of its purpose
 (downloading Debian sources for the Finnix project to remain GPL compliant).
 Please do not send hate mail to the author, thinking he is anti-GPL. He's not.
