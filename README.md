# Extract source package info from Debian status files #

damngpl will parse a Debian-style /var/lib/dpkg/status file and extract source
package information about installed packages. This information can be used in
several ways, usually to download source packages.

Multiple input files can be specified on the command line, or piped into
standard input if no files are specified. Results are returned to standard
output.

The name damngpl was chosen as a tongue-in-cheek description of its purpose
(downloading Debian sources for the Finnix project to remain GPL compliant).
Please do not send hate mail to the author, thinking he is anti-GPL. He's not.
